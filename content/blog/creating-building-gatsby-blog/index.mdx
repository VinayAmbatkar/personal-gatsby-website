# Why create this blog?

I wanted to build a site which could reflect my evolution as generalist. I wanted it to be a blog, project show case site. I decided to gear up and build something.

This site took around 4 months to build, majorly because I am  lazy  and involved with some kick-ass projects.

I considered various framework, NextJS, Webflow, Gatsby, Plain native styling. In the end, I decided to go with gatsby because of two reasons

1.) I had never used gatsby to full extent. Only used it with other abstraction such us docusaurus.

2.) Wanted a blazing fast with some extensive control to do various things

# Things that you might notice in this blog


**Dark/Light mode ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ—**

We all love dark mode as developer. It's life saviour, what better than implementing. Designing it from scratch was challenging, I will be writing a blog on different approaches of doing it.

Meanwhile, feel free to play this button.


<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", margin: "60px 0"}}>
<ThemeToggle/>
</div>

**PerformanceðŸš€ðŸš€**

One thing I obsess over is performance, for me it's integral part of any UX. I decided to push limit, this website scores 100/100 on Google pagespeed.


<br/>

**Notion as CRM ðŸ“–ðŸ“–**

Notion recently release their API. I wanted to use to remove friction from writing a post. I'm somehow lazy.
Writing a markdown and then committing turns me off.

This was great value add-on to blog.

Sadly, lot of content format is not supported. Still it'll be helpful in writing content with only text and code.

<br/>

**Open source ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°**

I love creating tools for dev. If you like this blog, make sure to fork and use it as personal project.
Over next months, I will try to add more interactions especially animations using react spring or framer motion.

Do backlink this to blog, it'll be nice gesture to appreciate the work put in to this blog.

<br/>

**Showcase of my work and work I do  ðŸ’« ðŸ’« **

A major portion of my learning have come from project/startups I have worked on. So I wanted a page that could showcase my past project.

I wanted to give each project a unique look :D. I hope it comes out that way.

On the other side, Created a page for work where I could add better value.
