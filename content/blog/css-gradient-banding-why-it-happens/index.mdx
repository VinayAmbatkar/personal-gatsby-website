# What's leaky abstraction?
Leaky abstraction is when abstraction that doesn't work the intended way. Whenever we create abstraction,
it's almost impossible to cover all cases. And when it doesn't work, it's called leaky abstraction.

You'll be banging your head to know how things work. Whenever I come across them, I try to understand in detail and share it on  my blog. This will be
on tech, engineering or product front :D.
