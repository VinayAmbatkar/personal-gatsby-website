# What's leaky abstraction?

Leaky abstraction is when abstraction that doesn't work the intended way. Whenever we create abstraction,
it's almost impossible to cover all cases. And when it doesn't work, it's called leaky abstraction.

You'll be banging your head to know how things work. Whenever I come across them, I try to understand in detail and share it on my blog. This will be
on tech, engineering or product front :D.

# What's gradient banding and why should you core?

In short, there will be point when gradient start to look ugly due to strips :(

Switch to dark mode, otherwise it might be hard to observe due to constraints.

# So why does this happen?

Gradient is transition between two spectrum. The colors graduate from one stage to another in step.
But if dimension is high and available color in spectrum are less, than it is possible to have unavoidable strips.

This will be most common if your monitor/OS/rendering engine support less colors by default.
